### **Part I: The Hidden World of Oakhaven**

#### **The Penumbra and the Gloam**

Oakhaven is not a normal city. It is a **Penumbra**, a rare geographical location where the veil between the material world and its spiritual reflection, known as **The Gloam**, is exceptionally thin. The Gloam is a chaotic, dream-like realm of raw emotion, memory, and belief. This thinness allows for the manifestation of supernatural phenomena and beings within the city limits.

The energy that fuels this entire ecosystem is **Anima**, a psychic residue generated by the collective emotions and beliefs of Oakhaven's mundane population. Joy, fear, love, and despair all act as a power source for the city's hidden inhabitants.

#### **The Iron Accord of 1888**

For centuries, the supernatural factions of Oakhaven existed in a state of open conflict, a period known as the **"Shadow Wars."** This culminated in the **Great Fire of 1888**, an event blamed on a gasworks explosion by the mundane world, but was in reality a devastating magical battle that nearly tore the Penumbra apart.

In the aftermath, the surviving factions brokered a truce: **The Iron Accord**. This treaty established the fundamental laws of the hidden world:

1.  **The Veil Must Hold:** The existence of the supernatural must remain hidden from the mundane populace at all costs. A breach of the Veil is the highest crime.
2.  **Neutral Ground is Sacred:** Designated locations (libraries, certain bars, public parks) are declared neutral, where no faction may initiate hostilities.
3.  **Anima is a Shared Resource:** No single faction may attempt to "farm" Anima by orchestrating mass emotional events among the human population.
4.  **Mortal Lives are Inviolate:** The direct, unprovoked killing of a mundane human is forbidden, as it risks drawing unwanted attention and destabilizing the Veil.

The Accord is enforced by the **Ministry of Veiled Affairs**, a mortal-run organization created to act as impartial arbiters and guardians of the Veil.

### **Part II: The Factions of Oakhaven**

*   **The Ministry of Veiled Affairs (The "Janitors"):**
    *   **Headquarters:** The unplottable **Thornwood Building** downtown, which does not appear on any map or GPS and is invisible to mundane perception.
    *   **Description:** A clandestine bureaucracy of specially trained humans who police the Iron Accord. They are pragmatists and problem-solvers, not hunters. They use a combination of forgotten rituals, enchanted artifacts, and modern intelligence-gathering techniques. They are often derisively called "Janitors" by other factions for "cleaning up" supernatural messes.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Led by a Director, with field agents organized into departments like "Containment," "Analysis," and "Misinformation."

*   **The Gilded Circle (The "Merchants"):**
    *   **Domain:** The **Ticker's Market**, a secret, shifting bazaar that materializes in different abandoned locations each week (e.g., a derelict subway station, an empty warehouse).
    *   **Description:** A powerful cabal of alchemists, artificers, and enchanters who control the supernatural economy. They traffic in everything from bottled luck and solidified memories to protective wards and illegal magical reagents. They see magic not as a mystical art but as a science to be quantified, commodified, and controlled.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Governed by a board of directors known as the **Quorum**. Membership is based on wealth and influence.

*   **The Court of Echoes (The "Ghosts"):**
    *   **Domain:** St. Jude's Ossuary, the catacombs beneath the Old City Cathedral, and other places with strong historical resonance.
    *   **Description:** The oldest faction in Oakhaven, composed of sentient ghosts, shades, and other spectral entities. Their power is tied to the strength of the memories and emotions embedded in their haunting grounds. They are the keepers of secrets, as they can perceive the echoes of past events.
    *   **Hierarchy:** A feudal monarchy led by the **Lord of Whispers**, an ancient and powerful spirit whose true identity is lost to time.

*   **The Verdant Kin (The "Weeds"):**
    *   **Domain:** The city's parks, greenways, and overgrown industrial zones. Their influence is strongest in the sprawling **Rosewood Cemetery**.
    *   **Description:** A loose confederation of urban nature spirits, dryads bound to city trees, and shapeshifters. They are the embodiment of nature's resilience, adapting to the concrete jungle. They are fiercely territorial and view the city's infrastructure as a blight to be reclaimed. They operate on a system of instinct and ancient pacts, not formal laws.
    *   **Hierarchy:** No formal leader, but they often rally around powerful alpha individuals, such as the current coyote-shifter known as the **"Asphalt King."**

### **Part III: Key Individuals and Concepts**

*   **Director Marcus Thorne (Ministry of Veiled Affairs):**
    *   **Background:** A former MI6 agent recruited into the Ministry after a case in London exposed him to the supernatural world. Thorne is a hardened realist who has run the Oakhaven branch for two decades. He is tired, cynical, but fiercely dedicated to protecting the Veil.
    *   **Motivations:** Thorne believes the Iron Accord is a fragile dam holding back a tide of chaos that would destroy the mundane world. He sees all supernatural beings as inherently dangerous and unpredictable. He is secretly investigating ways to weaken the Oakhaven Penumbra itself, believing it to be the only permanent solution.

*   **Anya Petrova (Gilded Circle):**
    *   **Background:** The enigmatic "Chief Broker" of the Ticker's Market and a master alchemist. Petrova is known for her ability to distill abstract concepts—like courage or inspiration—into potent, ingestible potions. Her origins are unknown, but she has been a major player in the Circle for at least a century.
    *   **Motivations:** Petrova is driven by a desire for knowledge and the perfection of her craft. She believes that the Gilded Circle should be the true ruler of the supernatural world, as they are the only faction that brings order and utility to the chaotic nature of magic. She sees the Ministry as an obstacle to progress.

*   **"Lock" (Independent Contractor):**
    *   **Background:** An information broker and thief who belongs to no faction. Lock is a **Psychopomp**, a rare individual who can safely navigate The Gloam in their physical body. This allows them to act as a courier and spy, bypassing physical barriers by taking "shortcuts" through the spirit world.
    *   **Motivations:** Strictly mercenary. Lock's services are available to the highest bidder, making them a valuable but untrustworthy asset to all factions. Their primary goal is to earn enough capital to buy their way out of a binding pact made early in their career.

*   **Key Concept: Cold Iron**
    *   In the Oakhaven Penumbra, **Cold Iron** (unworked, forged iron, not modern steel alloys) is one of the few substances that is anathema to most supernatural entities and magic. It disrupts magical fields, burns spirits, and can be used to create binding circles. The Ministry of Veiled Affairs makes extensive use of cold iron in their containment equipment and as sidearms for their agents. The scarcity of true cold iron makes it a valuable commodity on the Ticker's Market.
